## About project

This is a compiler developed as the final project for the Theory of Computation course. The goal was to create a programming language, called EasyScript, and a compiler for it. Given a file written in this language, the program should perform the following steps: lexical analysis, token table construction, syntax analysis, syntax tree construction, semantic analysis, compilation to JavaScript, and execution of the generated code.
